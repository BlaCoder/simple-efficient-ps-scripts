# simple-efficient-ps-scripts
A series of photoshop scripts that helps making things that are simple, but always takes time and are repetitive;

I may be always refreshing this repository with simples codes that I made because I was to lazy to do the same thing over and over again in some cases. None of these scripts is super complex to make, but is nice to see some varied ways to countour a problem or even to solve and speed up some action;

Essentialy, I work with pattern making, so the main theme of these scripts may be things that occur more often in this area. I see so little around about this topic, it'll be nice to leave some things for who is interest in this area, and to myself, see some improvement on the long term! Feel free to contribute if you're interest!
